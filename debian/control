 While primarily being developed for the OsmoSDR hardware, this block
 as well supports:
  - FUNcube Dongle through libgnuradio-fcd
  - FUNcube Dongle Pro+ through gr-fcdproplus
  - sysmocom OsmoSDR Devices through libosmosdr
  - RTL2832U based DVB-T dongles through librtlsdr
  - RTL-TCP spectrum server (see librtlsdr project)
  - MSi2500 based DVB-T dongles through libmirisdr
  - gnuradio .cfile input through libgnuradio-blocks
  - RFSPACE SDR-IQ, SDR-IP, NetSDR (incl. X2 option)
  - Great Scott Gadgets HackRF through libhackrf
  - Nuand LLC bladeRF through libbladeRF library
  - Ettus USRP Devices through Ettus UHD library
  - Fairwaves UmTRX through Fairwaves' fork of UHD
